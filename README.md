Play around with circle collisions in an interractive simulation !

To run the project : `v run .`

Click anywhere in the dark area to add some circles, you can play with them by picking a rock (and changing it's size with the mouse wheel). You also have a lot of parametters to play with (change the gravity, the shape etc..)

to run an optimized version run `v -prod run .` (with gcc or clang installed), it will optimize the binary further so you will have more fps.
